## Project Overview

This web app was developed by a Ocholi, with the assistance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) integration. The app dynamically generates questions and answers from PDFs of Pathology and Pharmacology lecture notes, which are then used to populate a question bank database. 

## Features

- **Question Bank**: A comprehensive database of questions and answers derived from lecture notes
- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes NLP to extract and generate content from lecture notes.
- **ML Algorithms**: Employs ML models to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the generated questions and answers.
- **User Interface**: An intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the question bank.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
